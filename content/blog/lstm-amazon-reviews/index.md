LSTM built using PyTorch to predict whether a certain review is positive or negative (sentiment).

## 🍟 Results

A noticeable plateau occurs at around Step 5000 at the first epoch. A decrease in alpha (learning rate) is recommended and an increase in the number of embedding dimensions and hidden dimensions.
